## 1. OSI Model

###  What is the OSI Model?
The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model** is a conceptual framework that explains **how data is transmitted from one computer to another over a network**.

It helps to:
- Understand how networks work
- Standardize network communication
- Troubleshoot network issues

---

### OSI Model Layers

The OSI model is composed of **7 layers**, each with a specific role:

| Layer | Name | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| 7 | Application | User interaction |
| 6 | Presentation | Data format, encryption |
| 5 | Session | Session management |
| 4 | Transport | Data transport (TCP/UDP) |
| 3 | Network | Routing and IP addressing |
| 2 | Data Link | MAC addressing |
| 1 | Physical | Cables and signals |

Each layer communicates only with the layers directly above and below it.

## 2. LAN (Local Area Network)

###  What is a LAN?
A **LAN** is a network that connects devices within a **limited geographical area**.

###  Typical Usage
- Home networks
- Offices
- Schools
- Small businesses

###  Typical Geographical Size
- One building
- Campus
- Few kilometers

---

##  3. WAN (Wide Area Network)

###  What is a WAN?
A **WAN** is a network that spans a **large geographical area**.

###  Typical Usage
- Corporate networks
- Connecting multiple LANs

###  Typical Geographical Size
- Cities
- Countries
- Continents

**The Internet is the largest WAN in the world**

---

##  4. Internet

###  What is the Internet?
The **Internet** is a global network of interconnected networks that use the **IP protocol**.

It allows billions of devices worldwide to communicate.

---

##  5. MAC Address

###  What is a MAC Address?
A **MAC (Media Access Control) address** is a **unique identifier** assigned to a network interface.

- Format: `AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF`
- OSI Layer: **Layer 2 (Data Link)**

It identifies a device on a **local network**.

---

##  6. IP Address

###  What is an IP Address?
An **IP address** is a logical identifier assigned to a device on a network using the IP protocol.

---

###  Types of IP Addresses

####  Private IP Address
- Used inside a local network
- Not reachable from the Internet
- Common ranges:
  - `192.168.x.x`
  - `10.x.x.x`

####  Public IP Address
- Accessible from the Internet
- Assigned by an Internet Service Provider (ISP)

---

##  7. IPv4 and IPv6

###  IPv4
- Format: `192.168.1.1`
- 32-bit address
- Limited number of addresses

###  IPv6
- Format: `2001:db8::1`
- 128-bit address
- Created to solve IPv4 address exhaustion
- Improved performance and security

---

##  8. Localhost

###  What is Localhost?
**Localhost** refers to the **local machine itself**.

- IPv4: `127.0.0.1`
- IPv6: `::1`

It is commonly used for testing services locally.

---

##  9. Subnet

###  What is a Subnet?
A **subnet (subnetwork)** is a logical subdivision of an IP network.

###  Purpose of Subnetting
- Efficient IP address usage
- Improved network security
- Reduced network traffic

---

##  10. TCP and UDP

###  Transport Layer Protocols
**TCP and UDP** are the two main data transfer protocols at the **Transport Layer (Layer 4)** of the OSI model.

---

###  TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- Reliable
- Connection-oriented
- Ensures data delivery and order
- Slower than UDP

Used for:
- HTTP
- HTTPS
- SSH

---

###  UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
- Unreliable
- Connectionless
- Faster than TCP
- No delivery guarantee

Used for:
- Video streaming
- Online gaming
- VoIP

---

###  Main Difference Between TCP and UDP

| TCP | UDP |
|----|----|
| Reliable | Fast |
| Connection-based | Connectionless |
| Error checking | No guarantee |

---

##  11. Ports

###  What is a Port?
A **port** identifies a specific service or application running on a device.

- Range: `0 – 65535`

###  Common Ports to Memorize

| Service | Port |
|-------|------|
| SSH | 22 |
| HTTP | 80 |
| HTTPS | 443 |

---

##  12. Ping and ICMP

###  Ping
`ping` is a network utility used to **check if a device is reachable**.

###  ICMP
**ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)** is the protocol used by `ping`.

It helps diagnose network connectivity issues.

---

##  13. Network Commands

###  ping
```bash
ping google.com
````

Checks network connectivity.

---

###  netstat

* Displays active network connections
* Shows listening ports
* Helps analyze network activity

---

##  Key Concepts Summary

* The OSI model has **7 layers**
* LAN = local network
* WAN = wide area network
* Internet = global network
* An IP address identifies a device
* Private IP ≠ Public IP
* IPv6 was created to replace IPv4
* TCP is reliable, UDP is fast
* SSH: 22, HTTP: 80, HTTPS: 443
* `ping` is commonly used to test network connectivity
